            <p>HTML is a simple code that is interpreted by your web browser – such as Chrome, Firefox or Safari – to display a web page for the user.

HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language". HyperText means it's a type of text that supports hyperlinks between pages. Markup means we have taken a document and marked it up with code to tell something (in this case, a browser) how to interpret the page. HTML code is built with tags, each one starting with < and ending with >. These tags represent markup elements.</p>

            <p>What's a template, you may ask?

A template is a file that we can re-use to present different information in a consistent format – for example, you could use a template to help you write a letter, because although each letter might contain a different message and be addressed to a different person, they will share the same format.

A Django template's format is described in a language called HTML (that's the HTML we mentioned in the first chapter, How the Internet works).</p>
